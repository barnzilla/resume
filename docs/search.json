Created scenarios that forecasted Covid-19 cases one year into the future. Results were used downstream in a Microsoft Azure pipeline to help the Government of Canada forecast personal protective equipment demand and make evidence-informed procurement decisions.\n\n\n\n\nData Scientist\n\n\nCHEO Research Institute   2008 - 2019  Ottawa, Canada\n\n\nPerformed various modeling techniques on large datasets related to movement behaviours (physical activity, sedentary behavior, sleep) and health outcomes in children and youth. Analyses have been published in 70+ peer-reviewed publications contributing to an h-index of 40, which is equivalent to the research output of a full professor.\n\n\nServed as a “full-stack” web developer that designed, built and maintained five websites on LAMP stacks: activehealthykids.org, capl-eclp.ca, haloresearch.ca, outdoorplaycanada.ca, sedentarybehaviour.org.\n\n\nServed as lead author on seven ParticipACTION Report Cards on Physical Activity for Children and Youth (2011-2016, 2018), a knowledge translation product that has received one billion+ media impressions and that has an estimated collective ad value of $10 million+.\n\n\n\n\nFreelance Web Developer\n\n\nBarnzilla Web Development   2006 - present  Ottawa, Canada\n\n\nDevelop, design and maintain custom websites for clients on virtual private servers (LAMP stacks). Some of these clients are academic research networks where custom code is actively deployed to handle all aspects of conference management (e.g., abstract submission and review, membership and conference registration, fee processing).\n\n\nDevelop custom web-based dashboards that reshape, filter and visualize data based on user behavior (e.g., Canada Grains Council Trade Data Online, Covid-19 cases in Canada).\n\n\nHave developed and designed 50+ websites for clients since 2006.\n\n\n\n\nSkills\n\n\nModeling, Analysis and Visualization  R, Python, OpenM++, C++, SQLite, Shiny, Quarto\n\n\nBuilds, Deployment and Pipelines  Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake, Azure Databricks, Apache Spark, DigitalOcean droplets, Kubeflow, Kubernetes, Jupyter Notebook, Docker, Grafana\n\n\nStacks  Debian, Ubuntu, Apache, Nginx, MySQL, MariaDB, PHP\n\n\nFrontend  HTML, CSS/SCSS, jQuery, JavaScript, DataTables, WordPress, React, Vue\n\n\nEducation\n\n\nMSc in Kinesiology\n\n\nUniversity of Saskatchewan   Saskatoon, Canada"
